# ✅ Safe Portfolio Guidelines

**Never include:** real IP ranges, hostnames, usernames, emails, production logs, configs, or internal screenshots.  
**Do include:** methodology, generic queries/scripts, synthetic data, lab recreations, redacted images.

**Two-track approach:**
- **Internal notes (company systems)** → detailed evidence kept in approved internal tools.
- **Public portfolio (GitHub)** → anonymised write-ups + lab/demo artifacts only.

When unsure, ask your manager/mentor for permission to share a *generic, anonymised* lab recreation.
